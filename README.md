# Football Lineup Visualization App

## Introduction

Thank you for exploring our Football Lineup Visualization App! We appreciate your interest and hope you find the application useful.

## Acknowledgment

We would like to express our gratitude to each person taking the time to read this documentation. Your interest and engagement mean a lot to us.

## Important Points

In the development of this application, we would like to highlight a few points:

1. **Styling and Code Organization:**
   - Due to time constraints, the styling and code organization might not meet the highest standards. We acknowledge the importance of these aspects and plan to enhance them in future updates.

2. **Code Stability and Testing:**
   - While we have strived for code stability, comprehensive testing was not possible within the given time frame. We encourage users to contribute to the project by testing and reporting any issues they encounter.

3. **Design Patterns:**
   - The application currently lacks the implementation of design patterns, such as the repository pattern. We recognize the potential benefits of incorporating these patterns and plan to explore and integrate them in future iterations.

4. **Lineup CRUD Operations:**
   - Lineup Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations are not fully implemented. The focus was initially on showcasing a basic lineup visualization. Future updates may include additional features to handle various lineup scenarios, such as "4-1-4-1" or "4-2-2-2."

5. **Backend vs. Frontend Proficiency:**
   - The development was primarily done by someone with a backend focus, and frontend development may not be as polished. We appreciate your understanding and welcome contributions to improve the frontend experience.

## Conclusion

In summary, the development of this application was a result of time constraints and a focus on providing a basic lineup visualization. We value your feedback and contributions to help us enhance and grow the application over time.

Thank you for your understanding and support!
